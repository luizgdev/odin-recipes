        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a wonderful, healthy side dish for summertime. Only make when
            the grape tomatoes are in season, their flavor is key! Great in the
            oven or on the grill.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound grape tomatoes, halved</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>5 fresh basil leaves, chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place tomatoes onto a large square of aluminum foil. Drizzle
                olive oil over tomatoes and top with garlic, basil, thyme, and
                salt. Wrap the foil around tomato mixture sealing tightly to
                keep juices inside.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tomatoes are tender, about 30
                minutes. Cool slightly.</li>
        </ol>
